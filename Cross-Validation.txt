K-fold cross-validation is also used for model selection, where it is compared against other model selection techniques such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).

Generally speaking, k-fold cross validation technique for training the models is found to be particularly useful when there is a limited amount of data available, as it allows us to make better use of the available data for both training and testing the model.

It is important to learn the concepts of cross-validation concepts in order to perform model tuning with the end goal to choose a model which has a high generalization performance.

The advantage of this approach is that each example is used for training and validation (as part of a test fold) exactly once. 
This yields a lower-variance estimate of the model performance than the holdout method.

k-fold cross validation technique for training the models is found to be particularly useful when there is a limited amount of data available.

K-fold cross-validation can be used to tune the hyperparameters of a model. 
Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, the regularization parameter, and the number of hidden layers in a neural network. 

K-fold cross-validation can be used to select the best model among a set of candidate models.

The number of folds increases if the data is relatively small. 
However, larger values of k result in an increase of the runtime of the cross-validation algorithm. 
This yield model performance estimates with higher variance since the training folds become smaller.

For very small data sets, the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique is used. In this technique, the validation data consists of just one record.

The ShuffleSplit cross-validation technique is a popular method for evaluating machine learning models. 

The idea behind ShuffleSplit is to randomly split the data into a training set and a test set, then train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set. 

ShuffleSplit is particularly useful for large datasets.

By randomly splitting the data, ShuffleSplit ensures that every example in the dataset is given a chance to be in the training set, which helps to minimize bias.

In a Data-Driven World, there is never enough data to train a model; moreover, eliminating a portion of it for validation raises the danger of Underfitting and exposes us to crucial patterns and trends in our data collection, which increases bias.
